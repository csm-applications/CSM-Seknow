# :computer: Versions available

To create a system that is suitable to be used in multiple environments, we experiment multiple versions of the same system to facilitate the deploy in different servers.  This folder contains two versions:

- [Stable] Java version
- [Experimental] PHP version

> **Stable** means that this version was tested in real environments and presents a more stable version of the system. An
> **Experimental** version presents only a feasibility test aiming to evaluate whether the technology is capable of comprising with the needs of this project.
